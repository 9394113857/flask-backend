# Step 1: Set the FLASK_APP environment variable to point to your Flask app file (run.py)
$env:FLASK_APP = "run.py"

# Step 2: Initialize the migrations directory
# This creates a 'migrations' directory where Alembic will store migration scripts.
# Only run this once at the start of your project setup.
flask db init

# Step 3: Generate an initial migration script
# Compares the current database schema with your SQLAlchemy models and creates a migration script.
# This should be run after you define or update your models.
flask db migrate -m "initial"

# Step 4: Apply the migration to the database
# Updates the database schema based on the generated migration script.
flask db upgrade

# Step 5: Run the Flask development server
# This will start your app and make it accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
flask run

# Optional commands to manage migrations during development:

# Step 6: Check the current migration status
flask db current

# Step 7: Rollback the last migration if needed (downgrade)
# Use this if you need to revert the last migration applied.
flask db downgrade

# Step 8: Show history of migrations
flask db history

# Step 9: Stamp the database with a specific migration identifier
# This can be used to mark the current state without running the migration commands.
flask db stamp head
